# moment
Nothing fun about this repo.

This is my first trial of building a react app after reading [react documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) with some videos and watching youtube videos about [nodejs](https://nodejs.dev/learn).

Check my [pinned repositories](https://github.com/Olaleye-Blessing) for better projects.

I might later update this repo maybe after getting comfortable with nodejs.
